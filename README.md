## About

**MULTALL Stage Generator** is an open-source Python/Tkinter GUI application developed as part of Bachelor's theses at **FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences**, Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, in the course *Turbomachinery Design and Analysis* supervised by **Prof. Grates**.

The project was originally initiated in 2025 by **Jonas Scholz** and **Luca De Francesco**, building upon foundational work by **Marco Wiens**, whose earlier Bachelor's thesis laid the groundwork for the Python-based replacement of MULTALL's preprocessing pipeline.

MULTALL is a well-established CFD solver for turbomachinery developed by John Denton at Cambridge University. Its preprocessing chain traditionally relies on two Fortran programs:

- **MEANGEN** — Meanline design and thermodynamic cycle analysis
- **STAGEN** — Streamline curvature and radial equilibrium calculations

This tool replaces both with a modern, interactive GUI, making the preprocessing workflow more accessible, maintainable, and extensible for students and researchers.

---

## Features

- **Full GUI** — Tkinter-based input for all meanline, radial equilibrium, and grid parameters
- **JSON project files** — Save, load, and share complete design configurations
- **Meanline design** — Thermodynamic cycle calculation with multi-stage support
- **Radial equilibrium** — Streamline curvature solver with configurable span sections
- **Multi-stage** — Supports single-stage and multi-stage compressors with bleed air modelling
- **Blade profiling** — Bezier-curve blade angle profiles with automatic generation from radial equilibrium
- **Grid generation** — Variable grid with configurable sections, levels, and refinement
- **MULTALL export** — Direct `.dat` output file generation compatible with the MULTALL solver
- **Headless pipeline** — Run the full workflow from the command line without the GUI
- **Compressor maps** — Generate multiple `.dat` files with varying pressure ratios and batch run scripts
- **Debug logging** — Comprehensive debug output with timestamps, sections, and context tags

## Results & Visualization

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <strong>Compressor Map</strong> generated from MULTALL simulation data:<br><br>
      The compressor map was produced by running multiple MULTALL simulations across varying inlet conditions and channel contours. Each curve represents a different channel geometry, allowing direct comparison of aerodynamic performance across design variants.

      The flow field visualization was created using <a href="https://www.paraview.org/">ParaView</a>, an open-source data analysis and visualization tool. It shows the internal flow structure through the rotor and stator passages as computed by the MULTALL CFD solver.

## Quickstart

### Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Third-party packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The following packages are part of the Python standard library: `tkinter`, `os`, `sys`, `shutil`, `json`, `math`, `csv`, `subprocess`, `pathlib`.

> **Note:** `tkinter` is included with most standard Python installations. If missing, install via your OS package manager (e.g. `sudo apt install python3-tk` on Ubuntu).

### Clone & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonas0403/MULTALL-Stage-Generator.git
cd MULTALL-Stage-Generator
python main.py
```

> **First run:** the repo ships only the template `static/Populated_data.template.json`. Copy it to `static/Populated_data.json` before the first run — the template is only a structural reference with placeholder values to help you understand the file format, not a real design.

> ```powershell
> Copy-Item static/Populated_data.template.json static/Populated_data.json
> ```

### Headless Pipeline (No GUI)

For automated or debugging runs without the GUI:

```bash
python main.py --headless --json static/Populated_data.json --output outputFiles
```

This runs the full workflow — meanline, radial equilibrium, blade profiling, and grid generation — and writes the MULTALL `.dat` file and a debug log to the output directory. The JSON file is updated in place with the generated metadata and grid data.

> **Tip:** Back up your JSON before a headless run:
> ```powershell
> Copy-Item static/Populated_data.json static/Populated_data.json.bak
> ```

---

## Usage

### GUI Mode

1. Launch the application: `python main.py`
2. On startup, values are loaded from the project JSON file into the GUI input fields
3. Configure your turbomachinery design across the input tabs (thermodynamics, meanline, geometry, bleed air, grid settings)
4. Save your configuration at any time via the GUI
5. Run the meanline and radial equilibrium calculations
6. Review results in the visualization panels
7. Generate blade profiles from the radial equilibrium data
8. Export the MULTALL-compatible `.dat` output file

### Compressor Map Generation

The "Other-Settings" tab provides tools for running parametric MULTALL studies:

1. Generate a single grid `.dat` file via the grid generation workflow
2. Enable "Create multiple DAT files for compressor map"
3. Configure the pressure range (start, end, step) and filename template
4. Click "Generate Outputfile" to create multiple `.dat` files with varying back pressure
5. Optionally generate a batch script (`run_all.bat`) to execute all cases through MULTALL
6. Check "Run MULTALL after generation" to launch the solver automatically

### Configuration Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `static/Populated_data.json` | Main project file — all design parameters (created from the template on first run) |
| `static/Populated_data.template.json` | Template with placeholder values — reference for the JSON structure |

## JSON Project Files

All calculation inputs are stored in a single `.json` file. This file serves as both the persistent settings store and the input format for the calculation backend. You can either configure everything through the GUI or write values directly into the JSON before starting.

The JSON is structured into the following top-level sections:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Thermodynamic_input_data` | RPM, mass flow, pressure ratio, efficiencies, gas properties |
| `Meanline_input_data` | Per-stage diameters, chord lengths, blade counts, solidity, angles |
| `Diameter_data` | Hub, mean, and shroud diameter distributions |
| `Bezier_point_data` | Blade angle control points for Bezier profiling |
| `Metadata` | Grid settings, output paths, levels configuration |
| `Grid_data` | Grid dimensions (IM, JM, KM), section definitions |
| `Bleed_air_data` | Bleed air mass flow and position per stage |
| `Intake_Outtake_area` | Inlet and outlet duct areas |

A template file with placeholder values is available at `static/Populated_data.template.json`.

## Roadmap

### In Progress

| # | Feature |
|---|---------|
| 1 | MULTALL output file generator validation across all configurations |
| 2 | Extensive code validation — verify calculation correctness across all configurations |
| 3 | Autonomous headless running — prevent plots from opening during headless mode so agents and optimization scripts can run without manual intervention |
| 4 | Fix bleed air 0-patches bug — setting 0 patches doesn't update properly, output still contains bleed cards |

### Planned

| # | Feature |
|---|---------|
| 1 | **Undo/Redo** — track edit history on JSON fields for safe experimentation |
| 2 | **Integrate compressor map plotting pipeline** — extract data from `global_*.csv`, calculate derived values, merge across MULTALL runs, feed into plotting program |
| 3 | **Add cmd output save option to GUI auto run** — save console output to `.md`/`.txt` instead of just displaying it |
| 4 | **User-defined blade profiles** — import custom blade angle distributions from CSV |
| 5 | **Plotting dashboard** — dedicated tab with real-time plots of velocity triangles, stage loading, reaction, efficiency vs. stage |
| 6 | **Design of Experiments** — parametric sweeps over multiple variables (chord, solidity, RPM) for automated trade studies |
